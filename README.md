# Math-for-All

**Ethos for Projects in Mathematics, Physics, and Scientific Computing**

This repository is home to open-source tools and discoveries (hopefully!) in modern mathematical science—beginning with the **Geometric Refinement Transform (GRT)**.

This space is grounded in the following tenets:

- **Accessibility**: Mathematical tools should be free to learn, apply, and build on—regardless of institution, background, or title.

- **Clarity**: Insights should not be hidden behind obscure names or inaccessible language. Making knowledge legible uplifts the human condition.

- **Community**: We celebrate the efforts of learners and contributors alike. The challenges ahead are grand—and we intend to rise to them together.

- **Academic Respect and Kindness**: Disagreement and critique are essential—but must be practiced with civility, curiosity, and generosity. Everyone deserves the dignity of being taken seriously.

- **Peer Review, Not Gatekeeping**: We believe in rigorous questioning and high standards—but also in open doors. Review should refine ideas, not exclude voices. All work here has the ultimate goal of peer review. Platforming work without the expectation of peer review is not part of the scientific method.

The GRT is a new framework for refining and decomposing functions using geometry-first logic. It aims to make nonlinear PDEs, real-time simulations, and adaptive transforms more intuitive, stable, and computationally efficient. This work is currently under development. Check in periodically for updates.
